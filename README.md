### Briefing
All the necessary methods and HTML are in the Main.vue file. In the data property of the Main.vue, you must change the accessKey and use your own Access Key that you have taken from Unsplash API.
An axios call gets all the necessary data from Unsplash API, if you want to see more of the data, you may check the response from your console.

### You need to create a new project from Unplash API and get an access key for your own usage.
